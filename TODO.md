# TODO: Fix View Button for PDFs in Chat.jsx

- [x] Add a helper function to convert data URL to blob URL
- [x] Update the View button's onClick to use the blob URL instead of direct data URL
- [x] Test the fix by sending a PDF and clicking View (fixed error handling)
- [x] Fix server-side PDF upload to store data URLs directly without Cloudinary
